# ðŸ“‚ STRUCTURE.md

Updated token structure and rules reflecting the Relational Color Matrix (contracts.rel) and the BaseÂ±N tone scale.

## ðŸ”¹ Relational Matrix (contracts/rel)

The matrix is the single source of truth for colors across:

- Plane: `surface | stroke | onSurface | label | border`
- Role: `neutral | accent | positive | negative | warning`
- Tone (ladder): `base-3 â€¦ base+3` (numeric, themeâ€‘agnostic)
- State: `idle | hover | pressed | focus | disabled`

Token path:

- `contracts/rel/<plane>/<role>/<tone>/<state>`

Validation regex for component token values:

- `^contracts/rel/(surface|stroke|onSurface|label|border)/(neutral|accent|positive|negative|warning)/base([+-][1-3])?/(idle|hover|pressed|focus|disabled)$`

Rules:

- Components do not use raw hex; only references to `contracts/rel/*`.
- Role must be consistent within a visual entity for background/border/foreground.
- For `foreground`, WCAG contrast against the associated `surface` is mandatory.

## ðŸ”¹ Deltas & State Generation (config/rel)

- States are deterministically derived from the base tone using perceptual OKLCH deltas.
- Example defaults (theme may override):
  - hover: Î”L +0.03 (light) / âˆ’0.03 (dark)
  - pressed: Î”L âˆ’0.04 (light) / +0.04 (dark)
  - disabled: Î± âˆ’0.50, Î”C âˆ’0.20 (with text contrast enforcement)
  - focus: focus ring derived from roleâ€™s base `stroke` (+Î”C optional)
- Clamp L/C within safe bounds; when contrast is at risk, autoâ€‘select the nearest `baseÂ±k` within the same role.

## ðŸ”¹ Tone Scale: BaseÂ±N

- Unified numeric ladder: `base, baseÂ±1, baseÂ±2, baseÂ±3`.
- Convention: negative steps increase L (lighter), positive steps decrease L (darker), identical for light and dark themes.
- Legacy mapping (for migration):
  - `lightest â†’ base-3`, `lighter â†’ base-2`, `light â†’ base-1`, `normal â†’ base`, `dark â†’ base+1`, `darker â†’ base+2`, `darkest â†’ base+3`.

## ðŸ”¹ Component Tokens â†’ Contracts

Component tokens expose domain semantics but their values reference `contracts/rel/*`.

Example:

- `components/button/accent/primary/background` â†’ `contracts/rel/surface/accent/base-2/idle`
- `components/button/accent/primary/border` â†’ `contracts/rel/stroke/accent/base-2/idle`
- `components/button/accent/primary/label` â†’ `contracts/rel/label/accent/base/idle`

## ðŸ”¹ Build & Artifacts

- Generates resolved JSON/vars, coverage reports (generated vs curated), and logs.
- `unresolved-tokens.log` records unresolved references.

## ðŸ”¹ Linting & CI (recommended)

- Path validation: each component token must match the `contracts/rel/*` regex.
- Ban raw hex in components.
- WCAG contrast checks for `foreground` vs `background` across all states.
- `meta.origin`: `curated | generated | override` per value.

## ðŸ”¹ Authoring Workflow

1. Choose the component role (e.g., Accent.Primary).
2. Map properties to planes per contracts table (background â†’ Surface, border â†’ Stroke, foreground â†’ Label/OnSurface).
3. Pick a tone from BaseÂ±N.
4. States are produced automatically from theme deltas.
5. Run contrast checks and review the matrix in Storybook.

## ðŸ”¹ Migration Notes

- Replace legacy named tones with `baseÂ±N`.
- During the transition, legacy aliases may point to `baseÂ±N`.
- Add a token path/contrast linter and wire it into CI.
