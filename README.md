# Sparkpad

**Sparkpad** is an experimental project that combines a **custom modular design system and an MDX editor**.  
It is built on a token-driven architecture, supports custom icon sets, ensures consistent GSAP-powered animations, and provides a curated set of components tailored for real-world use cases.  
The project will later serve as the foundation for the upcoming **AlmaDS** design system.
