# AlmaProtoKit — MANIFEST.yaml
# Prototype UI Kit & design system infrastructure

project:
  name: AlmaProtoKit
  type: design-system
  description: >
    Experimental design system platform unifying components, tokens, fonts, icons,
    and utilities into a single code-driven environment with Figma integration.

structure:
  adapters: environment-specific wrappers for components
  assets: base resources (fonts, icons, animations, SCSS core)
  components: Vue components (atoms, molecules, organisms, templates)
  composables: Vue composables (global and local hooks)
  constants: UI constants
  stories: Storybook stories (components, tokens, pages)
  tokens: design tokens (JSON), theming (light/dark), build outputs
  typings: TypeScript types (UI, API, router, etc.)
  utils: helper utilities (units, events, sanitization, testing)
  manifest:
    - MANIFEST.yaml (machine-readable specification)
    - MANIFEST.md (human-readable documentation)

modules:
  adapters:
    description: Thin wrappers bridging base Vue components into environments
    categories:
      atoms: atomic components (button, input, icon, etc.)
      molecules: composed elements (forms, dropdown, snackbar)
      organisms: environment-specific blocks (editor, navigation)
      templates: high-level layout wrappers (headers, footers, menus)

  assets:
    animations: JSON animations (spinner, theme toggle)
    fonts: >
      Bundled Manrope font (Cyrillic + Latin, weights 200–800),
      offline-first but replaceable with CDN
    icons: AlmaIcons entry point (index.ts)
    scss:
      abstracts: tokens, base colors, breakpoints, themes
      core: mixins & functions (px2rem, themify, map-get)
      extends: animations, containers, component styles
      mixins: reusable mixins
      app: global entry points (app.*.scss)

  components:
    implementation: ".vue + .ts"
    typings: "Props & contracts in .ts files"
    tests: "Unit tests in .spec.ts"
    stories: "Optional .stories.tsx"
    categories:
      atoms: buttons, icons, inputs, typography, tooltips
      molecules: forms, dropdowns, snackbar
      organisms: editor, navigation
      templates: headers, footers, menus

  composables:
    global: theme, meta, connection
    local:
      - hover
      - clickOutside
      - drag-and-drop
      - seo
      - router
      - timers
      - storage

  tokens:
    src:
      abstracts: background, border, shadow, base colors
      atoms: per-component tokens
      molecules: per-component tokens
      templates: per-component tokens
      themes: light & dark
      typography: text styles and type scale
      tokens: spacing, stroke, roundness, gap, touchArea
    build:
      outputs: [scss maps, css vars, json]
      status: generated-only, excluded from git
    docs: structure.md
    figma:
      forward: Code → Figma (fully supported)
      backward: Figma → Code (compatibility only, not recommended)
      philosophy: Code-first, tokens are the single source of truth

  stories:
    components: atomic/molecular UI demos
    decorators: Storybook global wrappers
    pages: theme & token showcases
    utils: helpers for story organization

  utils:
    - px2rem
    - getPathSegment
    - event helpers
    - unit testing (Vitest setup)

  typings:
    - ui
    - api
    - router
    - localization
    - themes
    - declarations (.d.ts)

rules:
  - tokens/build excluded from git
  - fonts shipped offline-first
  - each component must include .vue + .ts + .spec.ts
  - adapters must remain thin wrappers, no heavy UI logic

summary:
  keywords:
    - assets
    - tokens
    - components
    - adapters
    - composables
    - utils
    - figma integration
  philosophy: >
    AlmaProtoKit is not a production library but an experimental R&D platform,
    where tokens and code are the single source of truth.
