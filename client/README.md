# Renum

### R&D Playground for UI & System Design

> "I‚Äôm not building a universal framework. I‚Äôm creating tools for myself to explore architectural and visual approaches. Renum is an example of my R&D work, showcasing how I think and design systems."

Renum combines a custom design system with an MDX editor. It‚Äôs not meant for everyone ‚Äî it‚Äôs a laboratory for experimentation, prototyping, and refining ideas.

## üöÄ Core Idea

A self-built design system that works like a lightweight framework:

- Typed components

- Design tokens

- Themes

- Consistent animations

- Predominantly my own composables

- Fully custom component library

- Custom icons from my another project [Alma Icons](https://almaicons.netlify.app/icons)

- SCSS core with mixins and utility classes

- My component [Vue3ResizeBounding](https://resize-bounding.netlify.app/) for intuitive resizable layouts

- Projects can adopt a simplified token model while retaining compatibility with the strict design system

> Everything is optimized for my stack and workflow, without the bloat of prebuilt UI libraries.

## üéØ Advantages of the Custom Design System

1. **Modularity & Scalability**

   The architecture is constructor-like: add new components, themes, or states without refactoring.

2. **Deep Icon Integration**

   Supports a typed set of multi-style and multi-width icons, specifically my own Alma Icons, solving problems that off-the-shelf UI frameworks often ignore.

3. **Right-sized Component Set**

   No hundreds of unnecessary UI elements ‚Äî only what‚Äôs needed for your workflow.

4. **Unified Application Style**

   The system is designed around my working approach, so any new project grows from the same foundation.

5. **Consistent Component Animation with GSAP**

   All elements follow a shared animation model, delivering smooth and expressive UI. For some this may feel like overkill, but for my style it‚Äôs essential.

6. **SCSS Core**

   A central SCSS layer provides mixins, utility functions, and helpers to streamline styling and maintain consistency across all components.

7. **Own Composables & Component Library**

   Most functionality is implemented via my own composables, and all UI is built with a fully custom component library, giving full control over behavior, reactivity, and design patterns.

8. **Resizable Layouts with Vue3ResizeBounding**

   The Vue3ResizeBounding component allows creating flexible, resizable UI panels, fully integrated into Renum.

9. **Strict Tokens vs Project Flexibility**

   The design system maintains a **strict and fully typed token structure** for scalability and consistency, while projects built on top of it can use a **simplified token model** for faster prototyping and iteration.

10. **Unified Token Source**

    Tokens have a single source of truth in JSON format. From this source, all design tokens are formatted into SCSS maps for use in styling, ensuring consistency across components, themes, and runtime styling.

11. **Runtime Styling Options**

    While the system primarily uses **JS tokens** at runtime, it can also support **runtime CSS variables**, though their usage is currently minimal.

12. **Full Test Coverage**

    The design system is fully covered with unit and integration tests, ensuring reliability, maintainability, and confidence when extending or refactoring components.

## üõ† Stack & Tech

- Vue 3 + TypeScript

- GSAP for animations

- Custom design tokens & themes

- [Alma Icons](https://almaicons.netlify.app/icons)

- SCSS core with mixins and utilities

- Fully custom components and composables

- MDX editor for rich content

- [Vue3ResizeBounding](https://resize-bounding.netlify.app/) for resizable UI

**Modular Design Tokens System**

> Developed a modular token system for the design system with support for JSON, YAML, and TypeScript. TokensParser and JSONBuilder were partially developed with AI assistance, but all architecture, integration, and other components were implemented independently. The AI-generated files are located in [`~/client/plugins`](https://github.com/yamogoo/renum/tree/main/client/plugins).

## ‚ö° Philosophy

Renum is a research-focused project, not just a product. Its main purpose is:

- Explore new UI and UX patterns

- Experiment with modular, typed, and scalable design systems

- Serve as a foundation for future personal projects

## üíª Demo

_Currently no public demo available ‚Äî project is intended for R&D and internal exploration._

## üì¶ Installation

# Clone repository

git clone https://github.com/yamogoo/renum.git

```

_Then open http://localhost:3000 to see Renum in action._

## üìù R&D Notes

- Not a universal framework; built for personal experimentation

- Components, animations, and composables are optimized for my workflow

- Design system demonstrates scalable architecture, typed tokens, GSAP animations, and icon integration

- Resizable layouts enabled via Vue3ResizeBounding

- Runtime styling can use JS tokens (primary) or CSS variables (secondary)

- Single source of truth for tokens: JSON tokens are formatted into SCSS maps for consistency

- Future projects will grow from this foundation
